#### *Role Responsibilities*

##### Team Leader

##### Team Member
> General member of the team responsible for producing work associated with deliverables, achieving towards successful delivery.

##### GitHub Manager
> Responsible for managing conflicting merges within master branches. Owner of repository.

##### Quality Assurance Manager

##### Meeting Minutes Facilitator
> Responsible for recording the minutes of each team meeting.

##### Agenda Production Manager
> Responsible for preparing meeting agendas prior to each meeting.


#### *Methods of Communication*

> - Biweekly face-to-face stand-up meetings within University grounds
> - Frequent live communications via private Facebook group as required:
    -	Posting on group page
    -	Live messenger communications (texting, voice calling, video call)
-	Mobile phone communications also accepted during instances of emergency (texting, phone calls)
-	Email communications as required for maintaining tracking of critical points of discussion.


#### *Work Allocation Methods*

> As we will be following a Scrumban approach to the production of this report and artefacts, team members will be responsible for assigning themselves work. This follows the practices outlined for work allocation within a Scrumban environment. The Team Leader will still maintain frequent enquiries with team members to ensure work is being produced timely.


#### *Decision Handling Processes*
##### General Decision Handling
> In any situation where a decision must be made between the Team, the general form of agreement will be “Majority Rules”. In the situation of 3 vs 1, where the singular member has a difference in opinion, justification must be given as to why they believe their opinion is correct. Team members must agree to remain open minded regarding opinions of others to ensure fair assessment to differences in opinion. In the scenario of a 50/50, a compromise must be reached to ensure a final decision is brought forth. If the Team is deadlocked at 50/50, a third party must be introduced and assist in the resolution process.

##### Dispute Resolution
> Dispute resolution will follow a similar approach to general decision handling in regards to a subset of team members having an issue with a secondary subset of the team. The Team Leader will be the moderator for the dispute resolution process, and maintain a non-biased approach to bring resolution where disputes may reside. If the Team Leader is causing a dispute to any of the team members, the entire team will come together to discuss the situation and come to some form of resolution, including the potential change of role for Team Leader as required. If all else fails, a third party will be brought forth to assist in the resolving of said dispute.
