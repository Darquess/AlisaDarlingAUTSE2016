#### Methodologies: 

- Exrtreme Programming (XP)
- Scrum,
- Feaure Driven Development (FDD) and 
- Dynamic Systems Develoment Method (DSDM)

#### Differences:

|	    |XP |Scrum |FDD |DSDM|
|-------|---|------|----|----|
|**Documenation:**|Minimal documentation |Minimal documentation |High Documentation |High Documenatation |
|**End user involvement:**|End-user is actively involved |Product owners represent end-users |Participate through reports |Participate in all incremental releases |
|**Team meetings:**|Daily stand ups |Daily stand ups |Sharing through documents |Sharing through documents
|**Size of projects:**|Small groups (4-10) |Any size |Any Size | Any size |
|**Sprint Cycle:**|1 to 6 weeks |2 to 4 weeks | 2 days upto 2 weeks | 2 to 4 weeks |

#### Advantages and Disadvantages:

##### XP
__Advantages:__
- Constant contact with end users
- High collaboration with smaller teams
- Uses Test Driven Development to ensure all features work
- Pair Programming allows for increased code quality

__Disadvantages:__
- End user may not be available for constant contact
- Requires everyone have intimate knowledge of XP

##### Scrum
__Advantages:__
- High level of communication
- It offers certification
- Sometimes leads to “quick-and-dirty” programming

__Disadvantages:__
- Sometimes leads to “quick-and-dirty” programming
- Product owners have lose control on the project
- Changing requirements allow customers to keep demanding more and more functionalities

##### FDD
__Advantages:__
-  High quality as a result of design and code inspections
-  Scales well to larger teams.
-  Documentation and reports suport creaton of complex applications

__Disadvantages:__
- No point in using for samller project due to complexity
- Less communication within and out of team
- Time-consuming planning and task tracking

##### DSDM
__Advantages:__
- Allows for efficient project management and strong control on the project lifecycle
- Requirement priority approach helpful in delivering most important functionalities first
- Emphasis on staying on time and with budget

__Disadvantages:__
- Documentation is complex and time consuming
- Is not very common and so is hard to understand
- Does not provide a tool and technique framwork

#### Study Case:
- Share Software Management Software
- Redevelopment of software
- Then maintanence and expansion of software
- 15-18 Developers
- New team members
- Geological Locality
- Ongoing project

#### Recommendation:
I recommend adopting XP and Scrum to suit the project. It is recommended to keep the same methodology throughout the different stages of the project as it will cut out the time used learning a new methodology. As the first stage of the project is a redevelopment of the already existing software the high feature planing and extensive, time consuming documentation of FDD and DSDM are not needed.
The close proximity of the team members takes advantage of the high amount of communication both XP and scrum encourage. The adaption of XP and scrum will allow a high amount of end user interaction (through product owners in scrum) even if the end users are not allways available.
The pair programming principal of XP will balance out the "quick and dirty" programming of scrum to ensure that the new code does not decay like the old code. The size of the development team and the size of the perfered amount of team members in any project for the methodologies allows for 2 or more teams that can work in parallel to increase speed.
