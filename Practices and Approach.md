Team B_Triple_A

## Approach
Undertaking this project, our team will be utilising the Scrumban methodology. We have opted to use this hybrid methodology as it provides us with the flexibility we require for a research/report based project. Scrumban offers our team the best of industry standard methodologies, and eliminates unnecessary documentation one would normally generate through traditional Scrum.

Scrumbans adaptability with regards to time boxing provides our team with the variable length sprints required to deliver specific milestones. With a known deadline, we have produced a work breakdown structure in which we have associated expected deliverable dates for said milestones.

## Practices
##### *Prioritization*
    Our team will be following the principles of Scrumban prioritization during our initial planning event. We will be prioritizing based on task dependency, where task B cannot come before task A, e.g.: Report drafting cannot proceed without methodology research. Tasks will be ordered from most critical to least critical within our To Do list (

##### *Scrumban Board*
    We will be utilising the Scrumban board practice for management of our work items. Our Scrumban board columns will consist of: To Do, Doing, and Done. This allows our team to visualize task progression, and overall project throughput.

##### *Work In Progress (WIP) Limits*
	As a standard practice within Kanban, we will limit the amount of tasks in progress at any one time. As we have a team of four, we will have a maximum of four tasks in progress. This ensures that team members keep their focus on one task at any given time, this supplements quality assurance towards actives tasks.

##### *Milestones*
	We have produced a set number of Milestones expected to be completed to ensure the total product is delivered. Each Milestone has been issued a deadline based on amount of effort involved, ensuring adequate time is provided to produce the expected deliverable.

##### *Pull Principle*
	In Scrumban, the pull practice is a process in which there is no work delegation by a higher authority. It is the responsibility of each team member to ensure they select the next upcoming task ordered by priority. The Team Leader within our group will not be responsible for assignment of work, however he will be responsible for frequent communications with members currently working on a task, to ensure steady work is being produced.

##### *Sprints (Iterations)*
	We have chosen to use variable time-boxing practices allowed by Scrumban, this provides our team with a set of flexible Sprint durations based on the effort involved with completing specified subsets of work. 

##### *Stand-up Meetings*
	Bi-weekly stand-ups will be performed face-to-face to ensure the entire team is on the same page. The Team Leader will organise a meeting place for the stand-up to take place and will notify the rest of the team several days prior.

##### *Estimation (Pointing and Grooming)*
	Planning Poker has been used by our team to produce the estimated “effort” associated with each task. If consensus had not been reached, discussions took place to raise any points regarding the disparity between the effort assumptions given.

##### *Version Control*
	GitHub will be our main central repository for managing documents in progress. Finalized documents will be pulled and uploaded to the Wiki once approved. The Team Leader is responsible for the management of merging conflicts.

##### *Client Interaction*
	The Wiki and GitHub provide a timestamp for the Client to review, to ensure progress is being made over the lifetime of this project. If any concerns are raised regarding the project, or questions require answering, the team will establish communication with the Client, either in person, via email, or the public discussion board associated with this particular project.
